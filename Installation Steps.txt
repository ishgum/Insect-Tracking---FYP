/*****************************************************************************

The setup I used was Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS. I simply installed it from a USB drive.

Before executing any of these commands, I connected the NUC to the University wi-fi
via ethernet - it was not possible to use the in-built wi-fi of the NUC as this no
longer had any antennae. To be able to use the University ethernet, you have to open
http://ienabler.canterbury.ac.nz:900/ and log on using your university credentials.

Please note the other tools in the folder are an example program for offboard control which is what 
the auto-pilot interface for the program is based off. The code was downloaded from: https://github.com/mavlink/c_uart_interface_example

Typically, plugged in via usb, the PX4 will be mounted on ttyACM0. However, sometimes it will be mounted on ttyACM1
or, if you connevt via a telemetry port using a serial converter, it will be mounted on ttyUSB0. I couldn't find a good
way to dynamically assigned this port, so it is in the parameters.h file. A useful tool to figure out what port it is on
is typing

   30  ls /dev/ttyACM*; ls /dev/ttyUSB*
   
This will show you what is connected. If it isn't ttyACM0, then change it in the parameters.h file and recompile the program.

*
*	Calibrating Point Grey Camera
*
********************************************************************/


/********************************************************************

I have tried to set up the camera in such a way that it does not need to be calibrated,
however, you may find that different camera settings will be more effective in different
situations.

To calibrate the camera type

	

	cd ~/../../usr/bin/
	./FlyCap2


If you have xming running this should open a Fly Capture window. 

There should be a USB 3.0 camera highlighted. Select this and press ok. This should bring up
a large window showing the video from the camera.

You can then select on the Settings button which looks like a bunch of sliders. This should
open another window and which should open up to the Camera Settings page - this is the only
you really need to look at.

The three sliders you care about are Shutter, Gain and Frame Rate.

First thing you should do is drag the FrameRate slider all the way to the right. Ideally this 
should be 45 fps at full resolution.

Next you should tune your Shutter and Gain values until you get a good contrast between the tape
and the background.

These settings should stay the same as long as the camera is powered, however they will default
back to their original values if you cycle power. If you want to save the settings go to the
advanced camera setttings tab and under Memory Channels click Save.

IMPORTANT NOTE: I could not successfully save the Frame Rate to maximum so this setting will have 
to be set to max on every flight. See Future Work for more details.

/***********************************************************************************************************

This details installation instructions for qgroundcontrol. My recommendation is to download qgroundcontrol
on a windows machine and monitor the aircraft from there. However, jMAVsim seems to work better in Linux 
and so it will be important to have qgroundcontrol to monitor that.

/*********************************************************************

Note that the program will automatically create a timestamped log file in the logs folder.
This file simply outputs all of the commands sent to the UAV.

If you wish to record more information you could add outputs to this file, or simply record your terminal session.

A tool I found very useful was TermRecord. Instructions found at http://xmodulo.com/record-replay-terminal-session-linux.html

***********************************************************************/

// TermRecord uses python's pip to install it so you first need to install pip

    47  sudo apt-get install python-pip

// You can then use pip to install TermRecord

    48  sudo pip install TermRecord

// It is now ready to use. Start recording a session by typing:
 
    49  TermRecord -o /home/ucnavi2/fyp/termCap/test1.html 		

// Obviously if you have a different file path, this will be different
// Then run the program as per usual, when you are done type:

    50  exit

// You should now have an html file that you can open with any web browser which will play back your terminal session
// You should be able to pause and speed it up etc.
// Note, I also installed a different terminal as I found it gave slightly better performance when used with this terminal recorder
// i.e, it played back nicer. It's not necessary at all, but if you want to, I installed fish - instructions can be found here: https://hackercodex.com/guide/install-fish-shell-mac-ubuntu/
 


 
/********************************************************************
*
*	Setup for wi-fi connection
*
********************************************************************/
 
 
/*******************************************************************

You are likely going to connect to the NUC over wi-fi so you can monitor it in the air.
This assumes you are using the aeronavics machines with the NUC and the Rocket modem.

The antennae for the NUC have been removed so you will need to use to modem. 

The first important point is that the Rocket requires power over ethernet (POE). Either use a POE adapter
or plug in the battery to the aeronavics machine.

Once you have done this, you should go into edit connections and add a connection. Go into ipv4 setting
change the mode from automatic to manual. Add a IP address

You MUST you an IP on 192.168.1 - I used 192.168.1.3 with 255.255.255.0 as the netmask with no default gateway.

Once you have done this, if you open your browser and type 192.168.1.20 into the address bar you should get a login screen for airOS

The user name is: ubnt
The password is: ubnt

To be able to directly connect to the modem from a laptop you need to change three settings. 

First click on the first tab which is a logo. And disable airMAX by unchecking the enable airMAX box. (Click change in the bottom right corner and apply)
Second, click on the wireless tab and change the wireless mode to an access point (you can then change the SSID name)
Finally, change the channel width to 20 MHz as this is what most devices support. (Click change and apply again)

If you now look in your laptops wi-fi networks an ssid matching the one you entered and you should be able to successfully connect to it.

Before you can connect to the NUC you need to change the ipv4 settings for your laptop. You need to change it to 192.168.1.(something)
I used 192.168.1.2 - Note that this something cannot be 1, 3 or 20.

You should now be able to successfully SSH into the NUC over the wi-fi link.

***********************************************************************/




/**********************************************************************
*
*   Advanced wi-fi setup
*
**********************************************************************/

/********************************************************************

This is a little bit more advanced but makes connecting to the network a little easier.
To be able to connect properly you have to set up static IP address on your desktop computer.
This can be annoying - especially if you want to change to another wireless network and have to go
in and change the setting to automatically acquire the IP address again. These steps are how to
set up the router so that you will automatically get assigned a correct I.P.


Assuming you have completed the earlier steps, log back onto the airOS by going to your browser
and connecting to 192.168.1.20.

Once you have logged in click the network tab. Change the network to router.
For simplicity I have added a picture named NetworkSetupPage so you can copy the setting directly.

Important things to note from the picture:
    - The WAN interface is the LAN0. This means that it is connected over the ethernet.
    - The WAN IP address is static and is on the 192.168.1 subnet.
    - The Gateway and DNS match the WAN IP
    - NAT is enabled, this is so that you can connect to the machine

    - The IP address for the LAN is on the 192.168.2 subnet
    - The DHCP server is enabled (this is what assigns the IP address)

This should mean you can keep your IPv4 settings on auto and connect to the network as per usual.

/********************************************************************
*
*	Setup for ssh connection
*
********************************************************************/

 
/*******************************************************************

The setup I used was using a windows laptop to monitor and control the NUC remotely.

To do this, you need to download PuTTY and XMing. See www.geo.mtu.edu/geoschem/docs/putty_install.html

PuTTY allow you to ssh into the Linux machine.
XMing allows things to be displayed back to the laptop i.e camera footage.

To allow you to connect via ssh you need to install openssh server on the NUC

	48 sudo apt-get install openssh-server openssh-client
	

You should be able to connect via SSH by typing in the IP address for the NUC (192.168.1.2)

To use XMing expand the SSH tab on the left hand side, click the X11 menu and enable XForwarding.



While not necessary, the final suggestion for this connection is installing TMUX.
A potential problem is that you could lose the wifi connection while you are flying. Using a standard terminal this
would result in the program no longer running. 

	49 sudo apt-get install tmux
	
Tmux allows the program to continue running as long as the NUC is on. If you lose the connection, you can reconnect by 
reattaching to the tmux session.
